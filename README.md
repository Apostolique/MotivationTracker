# MotivationTracker
Simple application to track days working on something.

## Description

The idea is based on the [The Every Day Calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar). The purpose is to make it easier to keep track of a specific goal. You can visualize the whole year and watch your progress throughout.
